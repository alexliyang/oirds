    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the set of tools that build an LMDB of images and associated ground truths, run a SGD caffe solver, and test a set of images against a trained model.  Each tool consumes a JSON configuration file containing properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Building an LMDB Image Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool works with data under a provided data directory. The tool traverses a data subdirectories prefixed by 'DataSet_' looking for xls files.  The XLS files provide names of images, types of items in the image, polygons surrounding for each item in the image.    The XLS file must provide three columns:\n",
    " * Image File Name.  Format is 'name.postfix' where postfix is any type (e.g. tif, png, jpg)\n",
    " * Image Mode Type (classification)\n",
    " * Image Polygon.  Format mirrors this example: [142 52;143 51;...]\n",
    " The tool then pulls images from a image subdirectory corresponding to the image name from the XLS files.\n",
    " \n",
    "An image may be referenced by multiple rows of XLS file, each with a different polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ground truth image is created for each image and associated rows from the XLS file.  The ground truth image is constructed in the same size as the original image with a black background.   Each polygon is filled into the ground truth image with a unique color assigned to each mode type (classification). \n",
    "\n",
    "The image and the ground truth are written to two LMDB databases.  The ground truth is written as a single channel image where each mode type is assigned a number from 1 to 255.  0 is background.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The LMDB script creates six outputs:\n",
    "1. png_raw - a directory of raw images, resized if requested\n",
    "2. png_gt - a directory of ground truth images, using the same size of the raw image\n",
    "3. raw_train - training LMDB image set\n",
    "4. gt_train - training LMDB ground truth set\n",
    "5. raw_test - testing LMDB image set\n",
    "6. gt_test - testing LMDB ground truth set\n",
